# Todos
Todos is a simple yet beautiful To-Do tool that is satisfying to use and even just stare at (surprisingly). For students, made by a student.

This is a project I made to practise and learn more about TailwindCSS, Vite, TypeScript, React, and this cool animated gradient React addon: (https://www.shadergradient.co)
